# ProjectML_0

## Description

ProjectML_0 is a machine learning-based project that consists of both a backend and a frontend. This project helps in deploying and managing machine learning models with a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend** - Located in the `backend` directory.
2. **Frontend** - Located in the `frontend` directory.

## Installation and Setup

Follow the steps below to set up both the backend and frontend.

### 1. Clone the Repository

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitneogi-a/Projectml_0.git
cd Projectml_0
```

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory twice:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the `setup.bat` script to install necessary dependencies and configure the backend:
   ```bash
   setup.bat
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the required packages and dependencies:
   ```bash
   marketmind
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running locally, and the backend should be configured and ready to handle requests.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can access the frontend application locally. The frontend will interact with the backend to display machine learning results and provide user interaction.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and submit pull requests for any enhancements, bug fixes, or improvements you may have.
