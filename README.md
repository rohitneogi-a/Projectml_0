## Description
**MarketMind: Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning** explores the use of advanced machine learning models like LSTM, SVM, GANs, and hybrid approaches (e.g., CNN-LSTM-XGBoost) to improve stock price forecasting. By leveraging diverse financial data—historical stock prices, technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and sentiment analysis—this study aims to enhance prediction accuracy. It demonstrates that hybrid deep learning models outperform traditional methods in capturing market trends and dependencies. Despite challenges like data quality and market unpredictability, the research highlights the potential of ML for algorithmic trading, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend** - Located in the `backend` directory.
2. **Frontend** - Located in the `frontend` directory.

## Installation and Setup

Follow the steps below to set up both the backend and frontend.

### 1. Clone the Repository

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitneogi-a/Projectml_0.git
cd Projectml_0
```

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory twice:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the `setup.bat` script to install necessary dependencies and configure the backend:
   ```bash
   setup.bat
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the required packages and dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd marketmind
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running locally, and the backend should be configured and ready to handle requests.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can access the frontend application locally. The frontend will interact with the backend to display machine learning results and provide user interaction.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and submit pull requests for any enhancements, bug fixes, or improvements you may have.
